  <h1 class="text-center">Quotes about design</h1>
  <div>
    <p>I think it is an economic decision. There’s a reasonable level at which to value design. There’s a diminishing return on investment at some fuzzy point. That’s different for every company and every situation... If you’re going to value design beyond that point, that becomes a values choice. That’s an intentional moment where someone says, “Look, I’ve seen the numbers. I know this doesn’t make any sense on paper. But this is something that I’m going to stake out at a leadership level and at a culture level. That we are going to care about design, and then we’re going to stick to it.”</p>
