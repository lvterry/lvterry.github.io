Bad execution:
Pick twoâ€”time, quality, or cost.

Good execution:
Thoughtfully choosing the scope such that things are built on time, on budget, and at a high level of quality.

Bad execution:
Saying "X will be done by Y date" means the person listening will do mental math (+30% or x2) to get a realistic estimate.

Good execution:
Saying "X will be done by Y date" is a commitment and the person listening will actually believe you. 

Bad execution:
The next major milestone is "launch" and it is 2 months away.

Good execution:
The next milestone is at the end of next week, and there are many such mini-stones before "launch."

Bad execution:
All decisions are rigorously considered and debated.

Good execution:
Expensive, hard-to-reverse decisions are rigorously debated. 
Cheap, easily-reversible decisions are made quickly. 
(Most decisions are the latter.)

Bad execution:
The product looked and worked better in your head / on the mock. 

Good execution:
The final product feels like its earlier incarnations come to life in full, vivid color.

Bad execution:
The team, lost in Groundhog Day, continues to debate last month's decision because they don't agree with it. 

Good execution:
Once a decision is made, everyone moves in lock step on implementation. Only substantial new information reopens the case.

Bad execution:
The full map of what's happening across the team only exists in fragments across different people's minds.

Good execution:
Everyone shares the same picture of what's happening because an up-to-date map is consistently maintained and distributed.

Bad execution:
Teams behave like one-dimensional characters, constantly erring in the same ways. 

Good execution:
Teams only make the same mistake once. Their disciplined practice of post-mortems lead to constant improvement. 

Bad execution:
Decision-making feels like playing slots. You never know what you'll get depending on the time of day or people's moods.

Good execution:
Decisions are made on top of easy-to-explain and internally consistent frameworks.

Bad execution:
Ask each team member what success looks like, and everyone gives you a slightly different answer.

Good execution:
Not only does the entire team follow the same North Star, they know precisely how to wayfind based upon it.
