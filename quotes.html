  <div class="quote mb-4">
    <blockquote>AI is a tool. Tools abstract and automate tasks. 
      Each new one adds abstraction and automation over what came before. 
      That's rarely controversialâ€”until it touches something people are emotionally or professionally invested in.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>I think it is an economic decision. 
      There's a reasonable level at which to value design. 
      There's a diminishing return on investment at some fuzzy point. 
      That's different for every company and every situation... 
      If you're going to value design beyond that point, that becomes a values choice. 
      That's an intentional moment where someone says, "Look, I've seen the numbers. 
      I know this doesn't make any sense on paper. But this is something that I'm going to stake out at a leadership level and at a culture level. 
      That we are going to care about design, and then we're going to stick to it."</blockquote>
