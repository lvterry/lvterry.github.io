  <h1>VendorFlex Mobile</h1>

  <p>VendorFlex is a special type of Amazon warehouses. It's small in size, easy to setup and shutdown – very flexible. It usually handles fast moving or seasonal products.</p>

  <h2>Context</h2>

  <p>The original task is to redesign a 10-year-old internal product. We want to keep most of its funationalities and make sure:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The new system is easy to setup in warehouses</li>
    <li>The new system makes order fulfillment process more efficient</li>
    <li>The new system has a short learning curve and better usability</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Here are some screenshots from the old system.</p>

  <h2>Target users</h2>

  <p><strong>Warehouse associates</strong> who work from the VendorFlex nodes (warehouses) are the primary users of the system. They need it for their day-to-day work like processing orders, packaging and shipping.</p>
  <p><strong>Administrators</strong> who work from the office are the secondary users. Their work includes setting up the nodes, monitoring order status and reporting.</p>

  <h2>Research</h2>

  <p>We visited 3 warehouses in the US and Europe, observed and interviewed the associates to learn about their work. We identified improvement opportunities from the software UX perspective. More importantly, we understand better about their work environment:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>They’re walking all the time, carrying the laptop with a roller.</li>
    <li>The lighting in the warehouses are not as good as in the office.</li>
    <li>They need to deal with pyshical objects (papers, printers, goods) and software in the same time.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These are some photos taken from the warehouses.</p>

  <h2>Solution</h2>

  <p>Based on our findings, we came up with some design concepts that address associates' needs.</p>

  <h2>The real solution</h2>

  <p>We had some colleagues play with the concepts. Then we asked ourselves: <b>Why does it have to be on a computer?</b> If the users are always on the go, can we develop something lighter so that they can carry the system around?</p>
  
  <p>We then discussed with engineers about possible solutions based on mobile device. We considered multiple factors including development cost, cost of device, maturity of tech stack and so on. We ended up with a cheap handheld device by Honeywell. It has a scanner at the back and a full keyboard at the front. It can connect to the internet and run web apps.</p>

  <p>We quickly made some design and usable prototypes. A good thing about switching to mobile is that we got to further reduce information on the screen and make it really simple.</p>

  <p>We delivered the devices and software to some VendorFlex nodes. With some basic training, the associates can all learn to use the new system. The feedback is quite positive, some are excited.</p>

  <h2>Learnings</h2>

  <p>This project is one of its kind in the team. We started with a goal of redesign and ended up with something different and better. </p>
  <p>I was the first designer in the team. With this project, I setup the collaboration model with the team and build great trust relationship. More importantly, we were excited to see it in the associates' hands and help them with their work.</p>

  <p>Here are some photos of associates using the device and software.</p>
