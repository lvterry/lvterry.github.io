  <h1>LinkedIn for students</h1>

  <h2>Context</h2>

  <p>LinkedIn China decided to focus on the student user group in 2021. Students are the future professionals and they represent the next generation of users. We know some of LinkedIn's value worked for them but others not. So we wanted to find a way to better engage students.</p>

  <h2>User Research</h2>

  <p>To better understand student’s behavior, needs and expectations, we performed a foundational user research. The research includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>1:1 in-depth interviews</li>
    <li>Online survey</li>
    <li>Desktop research</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The key questions are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>How do students think about their career?</li>
    <li>What preparation have they done?</li>
    <li>What are the challenges?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>363 people responded to our survey and 11 in-depth interviews were conducted. Some common needs and challenges emerge.</p>

  <p>We also asked their perception of LinkedIn. When students become LinkedIn users, not all value props make immediate sense to them. They don’t have a large network to start with. They don’t have lots of content in the social feed to read. They don’t even have enough materials to put on their profiles. While they struggle to get started, they do trust the brand and consider the people & information on LinkedIn more trustworthy than other similar platforms.</p>
  
  <p>What’s more, when we ask them to score some proposed features, some of them clearly stood out.</p>

  <p>These are existing features we’ve built over time, but buried in the LinkedIn App (which mainly targets professionals).</p>

  <p>With all these findings, we are more confident about the approach — make things more obvious through thoughtful reduction and better organization.</p>

  <h2>Brainstorming and explorations</h2>

  <p>It's important to engage stakeholders early and we organized brainstorming sessions with them.</p>

  <p>Together we were able to plot ideas on the following matrix.</p>

  <p>Cut the scope again to focus.</p>

  <h2>The Design</h2>

  <p>To be more aligned with user's habits and faster launch, we built it as a WeChat mini-program. We only kept three core user scenarios — find alumni, find a mentor and find a job. From the visual design point of view, we derived the company design system and added some flavors that young people like, such as illustrations and icons in different style.</p>

  <p>The mini-program attracted <strong>1 million unique users</strong> in the first two months after its launch.</p>

  <h2>Iteration - adding a homepage</h2>

  <p>Along the way, we observed that users spend most of their time in the Alumni module. We had two assumptions:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>users are most interested in this module</li>
    <li>users do not know about other modules</li>
  </ol>

  <p>We collected some feedback from the student pilot user groups and realized that there're some room for improvement in #2.</p>

  <p>So the team setup a new goal: How might we design a page that can help users quickly learn what LinkedIn can offer for their career development. And back to the drawing board.</p>

  <p>We did a more detailed analysis for all the information on the homepage.</p>

  <p>And made some design explorations.</p>

  <p>Quick user testing with paper prototype.</p>

  <p>Final version.</p>

  <img src="https://general-1258275882.cos.ap-chengdu.myqcloud.com/portfolio/linkedin/Homepage-final.png" alt="homepage final">

  <p>As you may notice, the iteration is not only about a homepage. It also introduced a new scenario - Q&A community for students.</p>

  <p>The result is a compromise after discussion with PM and Operation team. In retrospect, I don't think adding the homepage and Q&A is a good idea. It didn't solve the discoverability of the mentor and jobs feature (the goal of the iteration). And we lose the simplicity of the first version.</p>

  <h2>Learnings</h2>

  <p>Anyway, I learned a lot during the process:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>It reminds me again the importance of <strong>fresh eyes</strong>.  The outcome is always better if we have diverse perspectives in the team.</li>
    <li>We often skip user tests under tight timelines, but even quick and dirty <strong>user tests can come a long way</strong>.</li>
    <li>Mini-program works well for <strong>new user acquisition</strong> and landing users. But it doesn't work so well for retaining users.</li>
  </ol>
