	<h1>Career</h1>

	<div class="column-3">

		<p>My career as a designer started in 2006 when I made some CD cover and logo design in college. In 2007 I joined SAP as a UX Designer and stayed there for around 5 years. I learned all the basics of Design there. It was a great ride of learning and growing.</p>

		<p>I've worked in different kinds of companies since then. Some are multi-national companies like Amazon and LinkedIn. Some are startups like alive.cn. Some are local private companies like Wuage and Huobi. I found different companies have different expectations for the role Designer. But no matter what teams I work in, I reject to simply <em>follow orders</em> of PMs. I need to think the problem through. I need to know who are the users and what goals they are trying to achieve in their life. I need to know whether our solution is the best we can do to help them.</p>

		<p>My passion lies in creating good software. In all the teams I stayed, I managed to setup a working model that allows me to stand at the intersection of product management and design. I am grateful that all the partners had learned to appreciate my work in the end.</p>

		<p>It all comes down to the definition of design. That always take me back to the Steve Jobs quote - "<em>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.</em>”</p>

		<p>Over the years, I've developed some <a href="/principles/en">design principles</a> and been telling myself to stick to them. The measurement I use for good design is the fitness between the form and its context.</p>
		<p>On top of that, great products should have personalities.</p>

			<p>Terry was a fantastic team member and someone that definitely would want to be part of my future teams if given the opportunity. He <em>blends a unique and valuable computer programming experience with a keen eye for user interaction and design</em>. He is also useful in helping to balance competing product needs and planning out our <em>product strategy</em>. Terry is easy to get along with and great mate to have in your team.</p>

			<p>Good, smart, and hard-working. I liked the way he <em>thought about and approached problems</em>. Not afraid to speak his mind on issues relating to the company. Highly recommend!</p>

			<p>I hired Terry back in 2007 when designers in China were sparse and hard to find. I hired him not because of his design experience (in fact he had a little) but his strong sense of design and critical thinking skills. I could see the fine quality of a good designer from him. Terry proved himself that he is an excellent designer since he joined SAP. Terry showed his talent in wide range of design spectrum from understanding users, conceptualization, information architecture, prototyping in both low and hi fidelity, design specifications, and user testing across many product areas. Terry is a great <em>team player</em> working well with people at all levels with different ethnicities in different geo-locations and business areas. He doesn't talk much but he is very precise to the point once he does and he is a good listener as well to quickly grasp the subjects that you rarely need to repeat yourself. Terry is <em>very keen on the new trends in design and technology and is technically competent</em>. He can roll up his sleeves to implement his own designs if you don't stop him:-) Terry is very reliable and never failed on any tasks he were assigned. I have high confidence <em>Terry can handle any design challenge either independently or working in group</em>. I have to honestly say I still couldn't totally recover from the setback after Terry's leaving even two years passing by. I can take Terry back anytime if he wants to not only because he is a good designer but also a good person. Any company not hiring Terry as a designer is either blind and clueless about design!</p>
