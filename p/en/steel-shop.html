  <h1>Mini Steel Shop</h1>

  <p>Mini Steel Shop aims to help steel traders setup their mobile online shop with zero technical knowledge. It's based on the WeChat Mini-program platform.</p>

  <h2>Problem & Opportunity</h2>

  <p>The idea came from our observation. At the time, we were in some WeChat groups formed by the sellers. We noticed that they would share pictures of their price table with the group every morning. After chatting with some of them, we learned that this behavior is very common in the industry – salesperson would spread their stock & price information to get business leads.</p>
  
  <p>We identified some improvement opportunities:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The price table pictures are often a screenshot of Excel. Some are badly designed and very hard to read.</li>
    <li>The salesperson can’t leverage the stock and price data that’s already on Wuage’s platform.</li>
    <li>A picture is not a permanent place where others can refer to.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Solution</h2>

  <p>We want to give our customers a lightweight store inside WeChat.</p>

  <p>This store should be able to</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Auto-generate a real time price table (based on the price and stock data that’s already on the platform)</li>
    <li>Use WeChat’s built-in sharing functionalities so that it’s super easy to share them into WeChat groups</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Additional benefits of this product</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The store is always online and searchable inside WeChat</li>
    <li>The store can include brand and contact information</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Principles for ourselves</p>
  <ol>
    <li>It should be super easy to setup since most customers are not familiar with tech</li>
    <li>It should be laser-focused on the price table scenario which is already validated from customer behavior</li>    
  </ol>

  <h2>Key features</h2>
  <p>The first release only includes a homepage and a price table. Really simple by design. Displaying the price table on a mobile screen is a bit challenging though. We achieved a good solution after a few explorations.</p>

  <h2>Iteration</h2>

  <p>One week after its launch, we started to see customers sharing these mini-program price table instead of the Excel screenshots. We know it worked. We reached out to them to get feedbacks. Some other customers actively sent us feature requests too.</p>

  <p>We introduced 3 new features in the next release, based on customer feedback. In the meantime, we kept the simplicity and usability of the tool. Again, the new features were widely adopted after its release.</p>

  <h2>My role</h2>

  <p>Here is my thinking framework.</p>

  <h2>Learnings</h2>

  <ol>

    <li>To design a good product, you need much <strong>more than good design skills.</strong></li>
